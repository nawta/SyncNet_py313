- Processing speed: 191.4 fps

## [0.1.1] - 2025-01-24

### Added
- Proper attribution to the original [SyncNet implementation](https://github.com/joonson/syncnet_python) by Joon Son Chung
- Python 3.9 compatibility fixes for type hints with fallback imports
- PYPI_RELEASE_NOTES.md for tracking PyPI releases

### Changed
- Updated project description to clarify this is an updated version for modern Python versions
- Modified type definitions in `syncnet/core/types.py` to support Python 3.9+

### Fixed
- Type hint compatibility issues for Python versions prior to 3.10

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-24

### Added
- Complete refactoring for Python 3.13 compatibility
- Modern Python features:
  - Type hints throughout the codebase
  - Async/await support for concurrent processing
  - Exception groups for better error handling
  - Dataclasses for configuration management
- Modular package structure:
  - `syncnet/core/` - Refactored core components
  - `syncnet_python/` - Legacy compatibility wrapper
- PyPI package configuration with `pyproject.toml`
- Comprehensive documentation:
  - README.md with installation and usage instructions
  - CLAUDE.md for AI-assisted development
- Development tools configuration:
  - Black formatter settings
  - Ruff linter configuration
  - MyPy type checking setup

### Changed
- Migrated from `setup.py` to modern `pyproject.toml` configuration
- Replaced deprecated `torch.autograd.Variable` with direct tensor usage
- Updated S3FD face detector model loading with proper state dict mapping
- Reorganized directory structure for better maintainability
- Cleaned up intermediate files and temporary outputs

### Fixed
- PyTorch deprecation warnings
- S3FD model state dict loading issues with parameter name mapping
- Legacy model compatibility through dedicated compatibility layer

### Tested
- Successfully tested on example video:
  - AV offset: 1 frame
  - Confidence: 4.568
- Verified functionality matches original implementation

### Technical Details
- Python 3.13 primary development target
- Backward compatibility to Python 3.9
- Dependencies:
  - PyTorch >= 2.0.0
  - OpenCV >= 4.8.0
  - NumPy >= 1.24.0
  - SciPy >= 1.10.0
  - Other supporting libraries

### Notes
- Model weights (`sfd_face.pth`, `syncnet_v2.model`) must be downloaded separately due to PyPI size limitations
- Primary testing done on Python 3.13; other versions may have minor compatibility issues
